# FHIR R4 Resource Support

Source: HL7 FHIR R4 Resource Index, https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html

Status legend:

- `First-class`: Imported into local Django models/admin.
- `Parser/container`: Handled structurally, but not stored as its own local model.
- `Planned`: Called out in `todo.md` as a likely first-class model or importer target.
- `Snapshot candidate`: Accepted and preserved as a valid `FHIRResourceSnapshot` with `import_status="snapshot_only"`, but probably does not need a first-class UI yet.
- `Unsupported`: No first-class importer yet.

## Next Completeness Step

The app preserves unsupported but well-formed FHIR R4 resources as valid `FHIRResourceSnapshot` rows with `import_status="snapshot_only"`. First-class models can then be added selectively based on real imported data and patient-facing value.
