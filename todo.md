[ ] add a dietary component
[ ] fix the admin links for these: CatalogEntry, Basic, Linkage, MessageHeader, OperationOutcome, Parameters, Subscription, BiologicallyDerivedProduct, VerificationResult, ChargeItemDefinition, Contract, ResearchDefinition, ResearchElementDefinition, Evidence, EvidenceVariable, EffectEvidenceSynthesis, RiskEvidenceSynthesis, plus the medicinal product and substance definition resources. they were added with a simple model
[ ] significant cleanup of admin page links needed
[ ] another clarifying parse through every fhir resource documentation page 
[ ] a reconsideration of each model being an admin page primarily - we can probably use many of them as related without the first-class admin page link, and have a full list of all first class admin pages on another page
[ ] full page of links to each and every admin page
[ ] normal person clinical dashboard, with admin pages mostly hidden but relevant ones shown
