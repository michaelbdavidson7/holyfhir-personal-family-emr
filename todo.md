# Go-Live Todo

This app handles health data. Treat go-live as a staged launch: first private/local use, then trusted test users, then broader distribution only after the security, backup, validation, and support items are done.

## 0. Launch Decision Gates

- [ ] Define the first go-live target
  - [ ] Local-only personal use
  - [ ] Desktop app for one user
  - [ ] Small trusted beta
  - [ ] Public multi-user hosted app
- [ ] Decide whether this is a personal record viewer, a patient-held record tool, or a clinical workflow tool
- [ ] Decide whether the app will ever be used for medical decision-making
- [ ] Decide whether imported FHIR JSON snapshots are the legal/source-of-truth export, or whether model-serialized exports must become fully conformant
- [ ] Create a written "known limitations" page for users
- [ ] Create a release checklist that must be completed before every packaged release

## 1. Security & Privacy Before Go-Live

- [ ] Store database encryption key in OS keychain / credential vault
- [ ] Store Django `SECRET_KEY` in OS keychain or protected app config
- [ ] Confirm `DEBUG = False` behavior in packaged/release builds without breaking bundled admin/static assets
- [ ] Confirm production `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, CSRF trusted origins, secure cookies, and session settings
- [ ] Add a first-run secret/key generation flow for desktop/local installs
- [ ] Add a recovery-key export flow for encrypted database backups
- [ ] Add encrypted backup restore flow and test it with real sample data
- [ ] Add database backup rotation policy
- [ ] Add a user-visible "Export before upgrade" recommendation
- [ ] Confirm uploaded/imported files cannot escape expected directories
- [ ] Confirm ZIP import rejects path traversal entries
- [ ] Confirm uploaded JSON/NDJSON size limits
- [ ] Confirm PDF export size limits and timeout behavior
- [ ] Add audit logging for import, export, delete, backup, restore, and settings changes
- [ ] Hide secrets and PHI from logs, errors, and debug output
- [ ] Add explicit privacy warning before exporting ZIP/PDF files
- [ ] Add an emergency "lock app / clear session" action if relevant
- [ ] Audit where uploaded documents are stored today
  - [ ] Confirm storage path in desktop packaged app
  - [ ] Confirm whether document files live outside the encrypted database
  - [ ] Confirm backup/restore includes document files, not only the database
- [ ] Decide document file protection strategy before exposing it in setup
  - [ ] Do not show a document encryption/decryption toggle until upload/read/backup behavior is implemented end to end
  - [ ] Decide whether document protection means encrypted-at-rest file storage, encrypted backup bundles, or both
  - [ ] Add conversion/migration plan for existing uploaded documents if document encryption is introduced
- [ ] Keep setup wizard limited to real implemented choices
  - [ ] Show database encryption and password hashing as informational status, not user toggles
  - [ ] Keep password/no-password as the primary beginner-facing decision
  - [ ] Move backup and document protection choices into separate wizard steps only when they are implemented

## 2. Legal, Safety, and User Trust

- [ ] Review `DISCLAIMER.md` for plain-language medical/legal limitations
- [ ] Add in-app disclaimer: this is not a substitute for professional medical advice
- [ ] Add in-app disclaimer: imported/exported records may be incomplete or transformed
- [ ] Add in-app disclaimer: users should verify critical data with their clinician
- [ ] Add a "How to share with your doctor" guide
- [ ] Add a "What is included in exports" guide
- [ ] Add a "What is not included or may be simplified" guide
- [ ] Add a "Delete my data" / local data removal guide
- [ ] Decide whether HIPAA, GDPR, or state privacy obligations apply to the intended deployment
- [ ] If hosted or multi-user, complete a real legal/security review before launch

## 3. FHIR Import Readiness

- [ ] Keep `FHIRResourceSnapshot` as the raw source-of-truth copy for imported FHIR
- [ ] Validate incoming resources against local R4 schema where practical: `fhir/schema/r4/fhir.schema.json`
- [ ] Add import report that separates:
  - [ ] first-class imported resources
  - [ ] snapshot-only resources
  - [ ] invalid resources
  - [ ] unresolved references
  - [ ] duplicate resources
- [ ] Add unsupported-resource dashboard with resource type counts and example IDs
- [ ] Improve FHIR snapshot retention and import history
  - [ ] Do not create duplicate `FHIRResourceSnapshot` when `resource_type` / `resource_id` / `source` / checksum are unchanged
  - [ ] Still create a new snapshot when raw FHIR checksum changes
  - [ ] Add `ImportBatch` model for each upload/import run
  - [ ] Link snapshots to `ImportBatch`
  - [ ] Add admin summary for import batches: created / updated / snapshot-only / invalid counts
  - [ ] Add cleanup/compaction action for duplicate historical snapshots created during development imports
- [ ] Add import conflict handling for same resource ID from different sources
- [ ] Add import rollback or "delete this import batch" flow
- [ ] Add large ZIP progress/status UI if imports can take a while
- [ ] Add tests for malformed JSON, NDJSON, Bundle, ZIP, duplicate resources, and missing `resourceType`
- [ ] AllergyIntolerance orphan strategy: parser exists, but sample allergies can reference missing Patient IDs
- [ ] CareTeam sample coverage: importer exists, but current development sample zip may not contain CareTeam resources

## 4. FHIR Export Readiness

- [ ] Decide export modes clearly
  - [ ] Raw snapshot export: highest fidelity to imported data
  - [ ] Model-serialized export: app-created/edited data, currently partial
  - [ ] Medical summary PDF: human-readable, not a full FHIR export
- [ ] Make the exporter page visibly explain the difference between raw snapshots and model-serialized resources
- [ ] Add full JSON Schema validation for model-serialized exports using `fhir/schema/r4/fhir.schema.json`
- [ ] Add schema validation tests for every model-backed serializer
- [ ] Add exporter warnings when a model resource cannot be serialized as valid FHIR
- [ ] Add export manifest details for validation status and omitted/simplified fields
- [ ] Add per-resource serializer coverage beyond the current first pass
- [ ] Ensure model-created data does not silently disappear from export
- [ ] Add export tests for patient-filtered ZIPs and whole-database ZIPs
- [ ] Add export tests for resources with unresolved FK/M2M references
- [ ] Add export tests for empty optional fields so invalid empty arrays/objects are not emitted
- [ ] Add stable resource IDs for exported local models, not only database PKs if portability matters
- [ ] Add provenance/source metadata where useful
- [ ] Add user-facing "FHIR export is technical data for receiving systems" note

## 5. Current Model-Serialized Export Work

- [x] Add first model-backed FHIR serializers
- [x] Include local model resources in ZIP when requested
- [x] Add local R4 schema file: `fhir/schema/r4/fhir.schema.json`

- [x] Add focused regression tests for required fields and enum normalization
- [ ] Add real JSON Schema validation dependency or lightweight validator wrapper
- [ ] Expand serializers resource-by-resource instead of guessing all at once
- [ ] Serialize `Practitioner`, `Organization`, `Location`, `CareTeam`, `RelatedPerson`, `Person`, and `Group`
- [ ] Serialize `DocumentReference` / clinical documents correctly, including Binary attachments strategy
- [ ] Serialize relationships as real FHIR references where local FK/M2M exists
- [ ] Add a serializer conformance matrix to `FHIR_RESOURCE_SUPPORT.md`

## 6. Medical Summary PDF Readiness

- [ ] Keep PDF as human-readable summary, not "full export"
- [ ] Include actual data, not counts, for selected sections
- [ ] Keep default checked sections: allergies, medications, conditions
- [ ] Add optional sections for vitals/labs, visits/actions, immunizations, procedures, care team, documents, insurance
- [ ] Limit very large sections with "recent only" default and clear "include all" option
- [ ] Add date range controls
- [ ] Improve vitals/labs grouping by name and date
- [ ] Add doctor-friendly cover page with patient demographics, emergency contact, and generated date
- [ ] Add "source/last updated" line per section where possible
- [ ] Add PDF tests for common and large patients
- [ ] Add print/readability review

## 7. Patient Profile UX Before Go-Live

- [ ] Make patient profile usable for technology beginners
- [ ] Keep clear buttons for opening detail pages; avoid misleading patient-name links
- [ ] Make "all patient resources" page polished and easy to scan
- [ ] Ensure patient resource tiles link to filtered list pages
- [ ] Ensure all embedded patient profile views sort most recent first
- [ ] Limit visit/action rows on the profile page with link to full list

- [ ] Improve empty states and "no data yet" messages
- [ ] Add clear "data came from import / entered locally" indicators
- [ ] Add quick card for medications, allergies, and conditions
- [ ] Create a paramedic/emergency view
- [ ] Add caregiver/shareable summary view if desired

## 8. Admin & Navigation Cleanup

- [x] Normal person clinical dashboard, with admin pages mostly hidden but relevant ones shown as Clinical Resources
- [x] Add FHIR Explorer / full admin area for technical resources
- [ ] Significant cleanup of admin page links needed
- [ ] Reconsider whether every model should be a first-class admin sidebar page
- [ ] Hide low-level/simple FHIR resources from primary sidebar
- [ ] Keep a complete "All FHIR Resources" explorer page for advanced use
- [ ] Fix admin links for simple/generic resources added in bulk:
  - [ ] CatalogEntry
  - [ ] Basic
  - [ ] Linkage
  - [ ] MessageHeader
  - [ ] OperationOutcome
  - [ ] Parameters
  - [ ] Subscription
  - [ ] BiologicallyDerivedProduct
  - [ ] VerificationResult
  - [ ] ChargeItemDefinition
  - [ ] Contract
  - [ ] ResearchDefinition
  - [ ] ResearchElementDefinition
  - [ ] Evidence
